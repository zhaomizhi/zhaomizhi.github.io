I adopted a cute guy from [The Boston Animal Rescue League ](http://www.arlboston.org/boston-shelter/) last week. It is a great place. Volunteers working here will ask you to visit and play with the cat first and then decided whether you are a suitable pet owner. I think this is really great. Because there cats, they are living souls, they are not items. Each cat has his or her "catality".

Muji is a 6 months old, tab grey cat. She like standing in front of my big monitor and watch movement of cursor like this.

I used to think that there are more people living with dog than cats, because you could always see people walking with dogs, playing with them in yard. There are also lots of costumes for dogs in pet shop. However, when I did little search I find a surprising fact. According to The Humans Society of The USA, there are 83.3 million owned dogs, and 95.6 million owned cats. 

It is quite unexpected, right?

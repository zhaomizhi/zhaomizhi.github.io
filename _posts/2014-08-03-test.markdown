Here I am, after spending two weeks working on CSS and JavaScript, I finally make this website more of my personal style.

The reason I choose [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is quite simple: easy to deploy, highly customizable. Moreover, I do not want to deal with database as I only post articles or links. So the solution has to be light-weight and flexible. Jekyll satisfies all my requirements. Besides, a big bonus of using Jekyll is that all the posts are written in [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

I wrote essays in Markdown for my business analysis class. It is an ease to write articles without worrying about the fonts, layouts, line-heights... 

Currently, this site is hosted on GitHub Pages. The domain name is bought from [hover](https://www.hover.com). Highly recommend this domain management website. It is unbelievably easy to configure. The theme is based on [HPSTR](http://mademistakes.com/articles/hpstr-jekyll-theme/), which I hacked a lot, changing almost all the look. I kept the useful navigator bar, though. Hope I could design my own theme with similar functionalities in the future.

Plus, the background photo is [Lugu Lake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lugu_Lake). There you could see many lakes, wooden boats, friendly people. I really had a lovely time when I was there 3 years ago.

Here I am, after spend two weeks working on the css and javascript, finally make this website more of my personal style.

The reason why I choose [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is quite simple. It is easy to deploy and allows me to design, edit the pages as much as I want. Moreover, I do not want to deal with database as I might only post some articles or links. So the solution have to be light-weight and flexible. Jekyll satisfies all my requirements. Besides, a big bounce of using Jekyll is that all the posts are written in markdown.

I wrote some essays in [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) for my business analysis class. It is an easy to write articles without worrying about the fonts, layouts, line-heights... 

Currently, this site is hosted on github pages. The domain name is bought from [hover](https://www.hover.com)  ( highly recommend this domain management website, it is unbelievable easy to configure. ), the framework is Jekyll using [HPSTR](http://mademistakes.com/articles/hpstr-jekyll-theme/) theme. However, I hacked a lot in HPSTR theme, changed almost all the web presentation. I kept the navigator bar, it is quite useful. Hope I could design one with similar functionalities by my own in the future.

Plus, the background image is [Lugu Lake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lugu_Lake). Here you could see many crystal water lakes, wooden boats, tradition national minority customs, friendly people. I really have a lovely time when I was there 3 years ago.
